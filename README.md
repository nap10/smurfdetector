# SMURF DETECTOR
This is a small web admintool for the sourcemod plugin **[ANY] Player Analytics** by Dr. McKay
https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=230832

forked from Sinclair47/player_analytics https://github.com/Sinclair47/player_analytics 

## What does it do?
This webapp simply searches for all different IP's which belong to a steam account and then looks for other accounts which were connected to this IP's.  
The chances of that accounts being smurf/alt accounts is 95% :)

The other 5% could be:
- same internet connection (LAN parties, family members, living communitys, school/uni/internet caffee network, etc...)
- account sharing (borrowed accounts from friends, etc...)

So keep that in mind!

## How to install?
Download as zip (or clone) and copy all files to your webserver.  
Add your DB credentials in config.php.
 
That's it!
